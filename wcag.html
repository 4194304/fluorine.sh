        <p>Recently I switched to KDE6, so far it's been pretty nice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I wasn't exactly expecting to make it my full desktop after having bad experiences with it on X11 (but not KDE5), but the wayland version is great.</p>
        <p>In my usage of KDE6, I've looked at the various KDE apps that exist, from the ones that go all the way back to KDE2 like Konqueror, to the newer ones like Audiotube.</p>
        <p>What I didn't intend on doing was installing the entire kde-applications group, and one of the apps that piqued my interest was Kontrast.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kontrast is an app made to assess the accessibility of your text using the WCAG specification.</p>
        <p>The rating you can recieve ranges from 1.00 - 21.00, where 1.00 means that the two colors for background and text have the same luminance, and 21.00 means luminance and contrast are completely opposite, which is only possible with a strictly black and white color palette.</p>
        <p>As I've went through randomized color palettes in Kontrast, I have increasingly thought about how inconsistent the system is, and I randomly decided "why not at least try to make a combination that scores 1.00 but is readable enough?"</p>
        <br>
        <p>That strange experiment is the sole purpose of this page's existence.</p>
        <p>The color palettes I found are awful, but at least they're very readable relative to their WCAG score.</p>
        <i>A quick thing I wanted to add was that they're usually opposite (or near opposite) on the hue wheel, and the lightness has to be similar.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Without further ado let's begin!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="fb1">
          <p id="by1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="by2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="fb1">
          <p id="rg1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="rg2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="fb1">
          <p id="rb1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="rb2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
         <div class="fb1">
          <p id="mg1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="mg2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="fb1">
          <p id="bm1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="bm2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="fb1">
          <p id="mb1">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="mb2">&nbsp;color&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Those are the main ones, although there are many other color combinations that could yield similar results.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In order here are the color palettes based on what I found to be most the readable:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>#fe0808 (background) and #007bfe (text)</li>
          <li>#d1005a (background) and #0058ff (text)</li>
          <li>#56a230 (background) and #fe00fe (text)</li>
          <li>#357600 (background) and #d20000 (text)</li>
          <li>#ff8801 (background) and #03b2fd (text)</li>
          <li>#9b2958 (background) and #4e13ff (text)</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway thanks for reading this</p>
